### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-visiting-all-points/

On a 2D plane, there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by points.

You can move according to these rules:

In 1 second, you can either:
* move vertically by one unit,
* move horizontally by one unit, or
* move diagonally sqrt(2) units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in 1 second).
* You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
* You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.

Example :

```md

Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]   
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds

```

### My solution

x或y移動一步花費一秒，把目前點x到下個點x 和 目前點y到下個點y 取最大值記錄下來

更換目前點

```js

var minTimeToVisitAllPoints = function (points) {
    let len = points.length
    let now = points[0]
    let sec = 0
    for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
        let point = points[i]
        let x = Math.abs(now[0] - point[0])
        let y = Math.abs(now[1] - point[1])
        sec += Math.max(x, y)
        now = point
    }
    return sec
};

```
