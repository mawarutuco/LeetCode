### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/how-many-numbers-are-smaller-than-the-current-number/

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

Example 1:

```md

Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).

```

### My solution

```js

var smallerNumbersThanCurrent = function (nums) {
    let ans = []
    let len = nums.length
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        let num = 0
        for (let j = 0; j < len; j++) {
            if (i === j) continue
            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) num++
        }
        ans.push(num)
    }
    return ans
};

```
