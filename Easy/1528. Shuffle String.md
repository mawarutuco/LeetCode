### Question

You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

Example 1:

```md

Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

```

### My solution

```js

var restoreString = function (s, indices) {
    let ans = []
    let len = s.length
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        ans[indices[i]] = s[i]
    }
    return ans.join('')
};

```
