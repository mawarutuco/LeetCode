### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/description/

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.


Example 1:

```md

Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

```

### My solution

```js

var maximumWealth = function (accounts) {
    let ans = 0
    
    //method 1
    let result = accounts.map(item => item.reduce((sum, curVal) => sum += curVal))
    result.forEach(item => {
        if (item > ans) ans = item
    })

    //method 2
    // let ans = 0
    // for (let i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
    //     let sum = 0
    //     for (let j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
    //         sum += accounts[i][j]
    //     }
    //     if (sum > ans) ans = sum
    // }

    return ans
};

```
