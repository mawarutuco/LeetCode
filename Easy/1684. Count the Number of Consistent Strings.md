### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-consistent-strings/

You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

Example 1:

```md

Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.

```

### My solution

```js

var countConsistentStrings = function (allowed, words) {
    let ans = 0
    let allowedSet = new Set(allowed)
    outer: for (const word of words) {
        for (const char of word) if (!allowedSet.has(char)) continue outer;
        ans++;
    }
    return ans;
};

```
