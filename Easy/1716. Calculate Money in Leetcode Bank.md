### Question

[[https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-money-in-leetcode-bank/description/)

Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.
Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

Example :

```md

Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.

Example 3:
Input: n = 20
Output: 96
Explanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.

```

### My solution

```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var totalMoney = function (n) {
  let total = 0
  let money = 1
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % 7 === 0 && i > 1) money = i / 7 + 1
    total += money
    money++
  }
  return total
};
```
