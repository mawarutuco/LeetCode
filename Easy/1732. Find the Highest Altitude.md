### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/description/

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

Example :

```md

Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.

```

### My solution

```js

var largestAltitude = function (gain) {
    let ans = 0
    let num = 0
    let len = gain.length
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        num += gain[i]
        if (num > ans) ans = num
    }
    return ans
};

```
