### Question

[https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/)

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Example :

```md

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
 

```

### My solution

```js

/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {string}
 */
var mergeAlternately = function (word1, word2) {
    const len1 = word1.length
    const len2 = word2.length
    const max = Math.max(len1, len2)
    let ans = ""
    for (let i = 0; i < max; i++) {
        if (i < len1) ans += word1[i]
        if (i < len2) ans += word2[i]
    }
    return ans
};

```
