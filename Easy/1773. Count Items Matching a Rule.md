### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-items-matching-a-rule/

You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

* ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == type
* ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == color
* ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == name

Return the number of items that match the given rule.

Example 1:

```md

Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

```

### My solution

```js

var countMatches = function (items, ruleKey, ruleValue) {
    let ans = 0
    let targetIdx = -1
    switch (ruleKey) {
        case 'type':
            targetIdx = 0
            break
        case 'color':
            targetIdx = 1
            break
        case 'name':
            targetIdx = 2
            break
    }
    items.forEach((item) => {
        if (item[targetIdx] === ruleValue) ans++
    })
    return ans
};

```
