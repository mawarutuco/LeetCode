### Question

Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

Example :

```md

Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.

```

### My solution

字串轉成陣列=>反轉=>拼起來，比較原本字串是否相等

```js

var firstPalindrome = function (words) {
    let ans = ''
    for (let str of words) {
        if (str === str.split('').reverse().join('')) {
            ans = str
            break
        }
    }
    return ans
};

```
