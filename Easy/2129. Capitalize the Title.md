### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/capitalize-the-title/description/

You are given a string title consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters. Capitalize the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:

If the length of the word is 1 or 2 letters, change all letters to lowercase.
Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.
Return the capitalized title.

Example :

```md

Input: title = "capiTalIze tHe titLe"
Output: "Capitalize The Title"
Explanation:
Since all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

```

### My solution

先把所有字換成小寫

如果字串長度大於2，就更換開頭大寫接著小寫

```js

var capitalizeTitle = function (title) {
    let words = title.toLowerCase().split(' ')
    let len = words.length
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if (words[i].length > 2) words[i] = words[i][0].toUpperCase() + words[i].slice(1)
    }
    return words.join(' ')
};

```
