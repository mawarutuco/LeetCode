### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-words-with-a-given-prefix/

You are given an array of strings words and a string pref.

Return the number of strings in words that contain pref as a prefix.

A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

Example :

```md

Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".

```

### My solution

用 startsWith(字串) 或是 indexOf(字串) === 0 判斷字首是否符合規定

```js

var prefixCount = function (words, pref) {
    let ans = 0
    for (let word of words) {
        if (word.startsWith(pref)) ans++
    }
    return ans
};

//或是
var prefixCount = function (words, pref) {
    let ans = 0
    for (let word of words) {
        if (word.indexOf(pref) === 0) ans++
    }
    return ans
};

```
