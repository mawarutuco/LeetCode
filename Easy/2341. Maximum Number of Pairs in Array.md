### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-pairs-in-array/

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, you may do the following:

*Choose two integers in nums that are equal.
*Remove both integers from nums, forming a pair.

The operation is done on nums as many times as possible.

Return a 0-indexed integer array answer of size 2 where answer[0] is the number of pairs that are formed and answer[1] is the number of leftover integers in nums after doing the operation as many times as possible.

Example :

```md

Input: nums = [1,3,2,1,3,2,2]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation:
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[3] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [3,2,3,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[2] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2].
No more pairs can be formed. A total of 3 pairs have been formed, and there is 1 number leftover in nums.

```

### My solution

先記錄這個數字的數量

統整有幾對一樣的數字和剩餘多少不成對的數字

```js

var numberOfPairs = function (nums) {
    let map = new Map()
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (map.has(num)) map.set(num, map.get(num) + 1)
        else map.set(num, 1)
    }
    let ans = [0, 0]
    let arr = [...map]
    for (let item of arr) {
        let qty = item[1]
        ans[0] += Math.floor(qty / 2)
        ans[1] += qty % 2
    }
    return ans
};

```
