### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-with-limited-sum/

You are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:

```md

Input: nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]
Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation: We answer the queries as follows:
- The subsequence [2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[0] = 2.
- The subsequence [4,5,1] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[1] = 3.
- The subsequence [4,5,2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[2] = 4.

```

### My solution

```js

var answerQueries = function (nums, queries) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b)
    let ans = []

    for (let query of queries) {
        let qty = 0
        let sum = 0
        for (let num of nums) {
            if (sum + num > query) break
            sum += num
            ++qty
        }
        ans.push(qty)
    }
    return ans
};

```
