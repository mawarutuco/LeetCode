### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/

You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

Example 1:

```md

Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.

```

### My solution

```js

var sortPeople = function (names, heights) {
    let myMap = new Map()
    heights.forEach((h, idx) => myMap.set(h, names[idx]))
    return heights.sort((a, b) => b - a).map(h => myMap.get(h))
};

```
