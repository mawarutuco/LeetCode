### Question

[https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/)

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example :

```md

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

```

### My solution


```js

var isSubsequence = function (s, t) {
  let sArr = s.split('')
  let step = 0
  let tArr = t.split('')
  let ans = false
  for (let word of tArr) {
    if (sArr[step] === word) step++
  }
  if (step === sArr.length) ans = true
  return ans
};

```
