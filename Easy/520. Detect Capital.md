### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-capital/

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

* All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
* All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
* Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".

Given a string word, return true if the usage of capitals in it is right.


### My solution

```js

var detectCapitalUse = function (word) {
    let rex = /^[A-Z]+$|^[A-Z]{1}[a-z]*$|^[a-z]+$/
    return rex.test(word)
};

```
