### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/description/

Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.

Return any array that satisfies this condition.

Example :

```md

Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

```

### My solution

跑迴圈判斷數字，若奇數就丟odd陣列，若偶數就丟even陣列，最後輸入前面even後面odd組成的陣列

```js

var sortArrayByParity = function (nums) {
    let odd = []
    let even = []
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num % 2 === 0) even.push(num)
        else odd.push(num)
    }
    return [...even, ...odd]
};

```
