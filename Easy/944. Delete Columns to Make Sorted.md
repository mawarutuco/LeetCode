### Question

You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid. For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as:

```md
abc
bce
cae
```

You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.

Return the number of columns that you will delete.

Example 1:

```md

Input: strs = ["cba","daf","ghi"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
  cba
  daf
  ghi
Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column.

```

### My solution

```js

var minDeletionSize = function (strs) {
    let len = strs.length
    let strLen = strs[0].length
    let arr = []
    let set = new Set()
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        let str = strs[i]
        for (let j = 0; j < strLen; j++) {
            let w = str[j]
            if (arr[j] > w) set.add(j)
            arr[j] = w
        }
    }
    return set.size
};

```
