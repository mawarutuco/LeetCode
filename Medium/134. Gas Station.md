### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/

There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

Example 1:

```md

Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

```

### My solution

用 totalTank 存所有 gas 扣除 cost ，得出整趟旅程油是否夠繞回起始點，若加總起來小於0表示油不夠用，於是return -1

用 curTank 存這個點的 gas 扣除 cost，得出這個點的油是否能撐到下個點，若小於0表示撐不到，也表示這裡不是合當起始點，於是startIdx(起始點)要更換

```js

var canCompleteCircuit = function (gas, cost) {
    let len = gas.length
    let totalTank = 0
    let curTank = 0
    let startIdx = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        let gasMinusCost = gas[i] - cost[i]
        totalTank += gasMinusCost
        curTank += gasMinusCost
        if (curTank < 0) {
            startIdx = i + 1
            curTank = 0
        }
    }
    return (totalTank < 0) ? -1 : startIdx
};

```
