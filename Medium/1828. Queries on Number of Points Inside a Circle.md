### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-on-number-of-points-inside-a-circle/description/

You are given an array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] is the coordinates of the ith point on a 2D plane. Multiple points can have the same coordinates.

You are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj] describes a circle centered at (xj, yj) with a radius of rj.

For each query queries[j], compute the number of points inside the jth circle. Points on the border of the circle are considered inside.

Return an array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.

Example :

```md

Input: points = [[1,3],[3,3],[5,3],[2,2]], queries = [[2,3,1],[4,3,1],[1,1,2]]
Output: [3,2,2]
Explanation: The points and circles are shown above.
queries[0] is the green circle, queries[1] is the red circle, and queries[2] is the blue circle.

```

### My solution

第一個迴圈分別抓出各個 圓心和半徑

第二個迴圈計算 各點和圓心的距離是否超過半徑，沒超過代表點在圓圈內故result +

```js

var countPoints = function (points, queries) {
    let qLen = queries.length
    let pLen = points.length
    let ans = []
    for (let i = 0; i < qLen; i++) {
        let result = 0
        let cx = queries[i][0]
        let cy = queries[i][1]
        let r = queries[i][2]
        for (let j = 0; j < pLen; j++) {
            let px = points[j][0]
            let py = points[j][1]
            if ((square(cx - px) + square(cy - py)) <= square(r)) result++
        }
        ans.push(result)
    }
    return ans
};

let square = (num) => Math.pow(num, 2)


```
