### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/watering-plants/description/

You want to water n plants in your garden with a watering can. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the ith plant is located at x = i. There is a river at x = -1 that you can refill your watering can at.

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:

Water the plants in order from left to right.

After watering the current plant, if you do not have enough water to completely water the next plant, return to the river to fully refill the watering can.

You cannot refill the watering can early.

You are initially at the river (i.e., x = -1). It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis.

Given a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the ith plant needs, and an integer capacity representing the watering can capacity, return the number of steps needed to water all the plants.

Example :

```md

Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacity = 5
Output: 14
Explanation: Start at the river with a full watering can:
- Walk to plant 0 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 3 units of water.
- Walk to plant 1 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 1 unit of water.
- Since you cannot completely water plant 2, walk back to the river to refill (2 steps).
- Walk to plant 2 (3 steps) and water it. Watering can has 2 units of water.
- Since you cannot completely water plant 3, walk back to the river to refill (3 steps).
- Walk to plant 3 (4 steps) and water it.
Steps needed = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 14.

```

### My solution

plants 代表有多少植物，且每株植物需要多少水，capacity 代表水桶有多少水

若水桶內逐夠澆下一株植物就往下澆水，步伐 steps +1，若水桶內水不夠就要走回 index0-1 裝水，steps 需加上走回去裝水的步伐 + 再走去植物澆水的步伐

```js

var wateringPlants = function (plants, capacity) {
    let len = plants.length
    let nowCapacity = capacity
    let steps = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        let plant = plants[i]
        if (nowCapacity < plant) {
            steps += i * 2 + 1
            nowCapacity = capacity - plant
        }
        else {
            nowCapacity -= plant
            steps++
        }
    }
    return steps
};

```
