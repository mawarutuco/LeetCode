### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-rounds-to-complete-all-tasks/

You are given a 0-indexed integer array tasks, where tasks[i] represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level.

Return the minimum rounds required to complete all the tasks, or -1 if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.

Example 1:

```md

Input: tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:
- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. 
- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. 
- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. 
- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  
It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.

```

### My solution

```js

var minimumRounds = function (tasks) {
    tasks.sort((a, b) => a - b)
    let map = new Map()
    for (item of tasks) {
        if (map.has(item)) map.set(item, map.get(item) + 1)
        else map.set(item, 1)
    }
    let arr = map.values()
    let ans = 0
    for (num of arr) {
        if (num < 2) return ans = -1
        ans += Math.floor(num / 3) + ((num % 3) ? 1 : 0)
    }
    return ans
};

```
