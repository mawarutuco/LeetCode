### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Example 1:

```md

Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

```

### My solution

```js

var frequencySort = function (s) {
    let map = new Map()
    for (const word of s) {
        if (map.has(word)) map.set(word, map.get(word) + 1)
        else map.set(word, 1)
    }
    let ans = ''
    let arr = [...map]
    arr.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]).map(item => ans += item[0].repeat(item[1]))
    return ans
};

```
