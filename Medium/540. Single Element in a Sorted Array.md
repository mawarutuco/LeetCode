### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/description/

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

```md

Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2

Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10

```

### My solution

跑迴圈如果這個數字跟左右兩邊都不同，就代表這是唯一值

```js

var singleNonDuplicate = function (nums) {
    let len = nums.length
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        let num = nums[i]
        if (num === nums[i - 1]) continue
        if (num === nums[i + 1]) continue
        return  num
    }
};

```
