### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/description/

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

* You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
* Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
* Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.

Example :

你有一個籃子在fruits由左走到右最多裝兩種水果，最多可以裝幾棵樹的水果

```md

Example 1:
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.

Example 2:
Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].

Example 3:
Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].

```

### My solution

先判斷如果 fruits 水果不重複的數量小於3，表示每棵樹的水果都可以裝進籃子，因此return fruits的長度

trees 存目前裝多少棵樹的水果，ans 存最多棵樹是多少(最大值)

第一個迴圈作為開始裝水果的起點

* 若這棵樹和下棵樹水果一樣，就直接增加 trees
* 若這棵樹和下棵樹水果不一樣，把這棵樹的水果裝到籃子內(還剩一個空間)往下繼續裝另一種水果

第二個迴圈存接下來裝的水果種類
* 若籃子內水果種類不超過兩種就增加 trees，並如果超過ans(最大值)就把目前trees值給ans
* 若籃子內水果種類超過兩種，就跳出迴圈，並且樹的數量歸1(因為籃子內至少會有一種水果)

```js

var totalFruit = function (fruits) {
    let set = new Set([...fruits])
    let len = fruits.length
    if (set.size < 3) return len
    let trees = 1
    let ans = 1
    for (let i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
        if (fruits[i] === fruits[i + 1]) {
            trees++
            continue
        }
        let baskets = new Set([fruits[i]])
        for (let j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
            baskets.add(fruits[j])
            trees++
            if (baskets.size > 2) break
            if (ans < trees) ans = trees
        }
        trees = 1
    }
    return ans
};

```
